Project Overview

This is the frontend of the Invoice Management System, built using React.js. The application provides an interface for users to:

Log in or sign up.

View, create, update, and delete invoices.

Navigate through a responsive and user-friendly interface.

The frontend interacts with a backend API to perform CRUD operations on invoice data.

Features

Authentication: Login and signup functionality with validation.

Dashboard: Displays invoices in a table format with sorting and pagination (if applicable).

Invoice Management: Add, edit, and delete invoices.

Navigation: Includes a navbar with dynamic options based on authentication status.

Responsive Design: Ensures usability across devices of all sizes.

Tech Stack

React.js: Core library for building the UI.

React Router: For routing and navigation.

Axios: For making API requests.

CSS: For styling the components.
